								At the WVS website, I go to the data and choose a wave. 
								<img src="images/worldwaves.png" width=650 height=300/>
								<br/>
								It's not possible to choose all countries available at once so I have to patiently click all of the countries as I really want to get as much data as possible to see if I can find an answer to my question.<br/>
								<img src="images/countries.png" width=650 height=300/>
								<br/>
								I then look at some surveys that correspond to my question. Such as questions about the government, trust in people, satisfaction in life, nationality pride, the press and human rights.<br/>
								<img src="images/question1.png" width=650 height=300/>
								<br/>
								<img src="images/question2.png" width=650 height=300/>
								<br/>
								Then I look at the countries through the years (for as many waves the country has data that is)<br/>
								<img src="images/years.png" width=650 height=300/>
								<br/>
								It isn't easy to get an overview at this site. The data is very centered on the country and it's hard to compare different variables. Therefore it's hard to answer my question. I did find some small correlation between confidence in the government and the general trust.
								Even though I couldn't fully answer my question using this site's visualizations, it was intresting to see the development in the different waves for countries.<br/>

								In my visualization you can brush the different variables to see if perhaps there's a correlation between general trust in people and a perceived democratic government.<br/>
								<img src="images/pc1.png" width=650 height=300/>
								<br/>
								The brushed data gathers in a list below the parallel coordinates where sortable data is available for further correlations.<br/>
								<img src="images/chart.png" width=650 height=300/>
								<br/>
								For example I look at how the general trust in people has changed over the years, in correlation with being proud of your nationality. Which gives me the following
								<br/>
								<img src="images/1.png" width=650 height=250/>
								<img src="images/2.png" width=650 height=250/>
								<img src="images/3.png" width=650 height=250/>
								<img src="images/4.png" width=650 height=250/>
								<br/>
								which indicates that the trust has gone down. Further more, if I look at the correlation between trust and satisfaction with life, the ones with the lowest satisfaction in life also have the least trust in people.This goes true over the years more or less.<br/>
								<img src="images/leasttrust.png" width=650 height=250/>
								<br/>
								Another thing I noticed was the correlation between the ones with the least trust and the countries with the highest homicide rates.<br/>
								<img src="images/homicide.png" width=650 height=250/>
								<br/>
								It's difficult to get to a one perfect conclusion, as the question might have been a bit too open. However, as described above, one could find some interesting correlations regarding the different variables. And with the addition of the Gapminder data (mainly the grid at the bottom), one can take the correlations even further.

								I've realized how difficult and time consuming it is to find, clean and putting together relevant data. 
								One thing I have not incorporated is the ability to choose which countries you are interested in other than brushing. Similar to the WVS page were it is the first thing you do really. And being able to compare these over time. Other than that I have found it very interesting to look at all this data and putting it into perspective.
